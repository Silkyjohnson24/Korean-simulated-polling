# Korean-simulated-polling
This is a hypothetical output from a survey and analysis of human input, both qualitative and quantitative. My role was the data chief and the following explains my contribution.

Our teams data collection strategy was decided after my suggestion initiating a probe of military acceptance and United States' warmth of perception in the Korean region. This sent us on a smooth pathway to uncovering details of a highly specific and unique relationship embedded and organized within the South Korean population.  We decided to mention some history, to give a background on the Korean territory - which has not always been considered free of imperialist pressure. This fact had a direct impact on our deductive data collection strategy due to the older generation having a direct connection to the United States while also receiving financial assistance to rebuild the area. We utilized our deductive reasoning framework to describe an information collection machine that would pass their outputs to the data center. Following the receipt of those inputs, the data center would then apply any number of machine learning algorithms to clean, and refine the data for probing of patterns and insights.

The inductive perspective of our study sought to discover if the established sentiment of US persona and presence was favorable in Korea or not. We have archives revealing the polling numbers relevant to the starting point of our study, giving a good foundation there is data to source and leverage.
Using my data process including adherence to all FISMA and humanitarian ethics and compliance considerations. We designed a study that upon funding, should result in favorable returns and a fresh set of data from the region. Here is my outline below:

Sampling Strategy
Our research will capture a wide range of opinions of South Koreans from all walks of life. Accordingly, we will ensure generational as well as geographic diversity in the respondents. This is critically important to get an accurate picture of how different demographic groups in the country feel about these issues. The quotas are as follow: 

25% - Aged 18-30
25% - Aged 30-45
25% - Aged 45-65
25% - Aged 65+

Province Breakdown:
12.5% - Gyeongsangnam-do 
12.5% - Gyeongsangbuk-do
12.5% - Jeollanam-do, Jeollabuk-do
12.5% - Jeju Special Self-Governing Province
12.5% - Gangwon-do
12.5% - Chungcheongnam-do
12.5% - Chungcheongbuk-do
12.5% - Gyeonggi-do.

The researchers will collaborate primarily with the University of Seoul’s political science department and other local, trusted non-governmental organizations. The University will be responsible for maintaining labor used to conduct the survey. These prganizations were selected regarding their experience with both political polls and public opinion questionnaires. The University and staff will be compensated for their contrbutions. The data will be swiftly collected over the span of 2 weeks by utilizing the most modern API's (Application Programming Interface). 

Data Collection Strategy 
As noted earlier, it is a high priority for this study to ensure that there is adequate generational and geographical diversity. The researchers recognize that different generations of South Koreans will have different perspectives on foreign affairs, due to their different lived experiences. Additionally, geographic diversity is particularly important. South Koreans who live near a US military base may have a measurebly different view of America’s presence in their country than a resident who does not live anywhere near a military base. 

In order to account for this, the researchers will be targeting email, physical mail, in-person interviews, and phone surveys to people in different provinces throughout the country. For in person interviews, researchers will be specifically targeting areas in those provinces where the population is dense. Utilizing these different forms of communication will help to reach participants of different age groups. We expect to receive a minimum of 200 responses. Different age groups will communicate differently, thereby utilizing email, physical mail, phone calls, and in-person interviews will be an effective way to reach a greater pool of respondents.

In order to ensure the diversity in our responses, we are utilizing the quota outlined above. To conduct the survey, researchers will be using the program, Qualtrics. Qualtrics will allow researchers to process a large volume of responses and aggregate the data accordingly.

Ethical Considerations 
It is critically important that all participants in this survey know that their participation is confidential, their names will not be used anywhere. The data collected will be deidentified. Additionally, as noted above, the researchers will be utilizing South Korean researchers to conduct the questions. Participants may be less comfortable speaking openly and honestly to American researchers. 

Data Analysis:
In this study addressing the attitudes of the South Korean population and American military policy, the data analysis process will be continuous and uninterrupted. Our methods of collection will be scrutinized in the highest ethical regard, to include periodic and random auditing. Clearly inarticulate data will be placed into a container, discussed and either displayed or discarded with a note detailing our disposition.
 
This is to ensure that all information collected, both qualitative and quantitative remains within the highest degree of authenticity and compliance as determined by the relevant REC’s (Research Ethics Committees) The study follows industry established standards in data protection, echoing our recent colleague’s declaration, our goal is to protect the rights, identities, and welfare of our human research participants. Here at PDT consulting, we are pleased and enthusiastic to commit to the most modern standards in our industry. (Panichkul, et al 2011).
 
During our collection process, we will focus on closing in on the information contained within individual responses from a personal, human perspective. We will attempt to identify any patterns by execution of thematic analysis. Our intent is to uncover any hidden or reluctant data to identify resounding themes discovered during our accurate and precise handling of information.
 
Respondents will be placed into their respective categories, with corresponding percentages for each category to be calculated. The qualitative data derived from the respondents is subject to the same rigid vetting process before placement into their respective categories. 
 
Finally, we will observe participant response, and give a report on our findings by province, using the frame expressed above in the Research Method section. Using technological assistance (Python, StatCrunch, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) we will conduct an accurate and precise analysis of responses received, based upon the respondents age in addition to their geographical location. There is a collection of sample charts provided in the appendix for your consideration. Our general use of the math tools will be the basis for discovering any trends or outliers.
 
This configuration and successful execution will allow us to generate a visual aid (scatter plot and bar chart) using the “Province” as our Y axis which will be plotted against our X axis, the “Sentiment and favorability of US influence” from a 0 - 100 value indicating a general cold or warm reception to foreign influence and dependance. The data inputs will be derived from the interview (ex. color blue dots) which will be distinguished from the quantitative (polling) data collected (color red dots) allowing us some mathematical insight to the differences by region. An exact copy of this configuration will be administered to examine the ages of respondents by province, plotted on the X axis from the same scale of 0-100 in terms of favorability and warmth of reception to the US land based political influence. We believe this arrangement will expose the sentiment across the landscape and highlight any generational divides on this issue. 
 
To round out our data based visual representation, we will provide a quantitative assessment that aims to use the independent variable (Province) to express the total turnout collected from province to province. We feel this third visual representation will accurately display the favorability across all of South Korea, supplementing the scatter plot and bar chart. This third graph is intended to display concentrations in opinions throughout our territory of assessment.
 
Note: The design of the province bar chart will be as follows: Y axis - measure of favorability, X-axis - geographical placement of opinion. In the appendix there will be a sample of these three graphs with appropriate titles.
  
Hypothesized findings:
 
In our quantitative testing phase of the data collection process, we will contrast our deductive theory against other outcomes and published results (historical polling estimates explained above) to verify that total participant size is reasonable, meets standards and is in line. Our assessment will be corroborated by real estate data, tax records, and automotive registration. These baselines will give us a background to examine pre-determined and expected measurement statistics on record. Our tests will scrutinize the surveys and questionnaires handed out to willing participants with the purpose of validating results. The results will be driven by the application of structured, specifically phrased questions with a set of predetermined outputs for participant selection.
 
Our study has been operating a successful pilot program and we have collected information on the ground in many populated areas. We are confident that our authorized, funded study will continue to provide us insight to implementing process improvements where needed.
 
Qualitatively, these field trials will be conducted by face-to-face interview, using polling to capture participant response through open-ended questions supported by proven methodologies in polling standards, which we have successfully maintained by the pilot program named HSPC488.ci which has been running since January 2023.
 
Upon commencement, our survey should produce a reliable random sample which we will leverage to gain significant statistical insight, strengthening our deductive assumptions. 
 
Quantitative findings:  
 
Quantitative results will be derived from a well-designed survey (see parameters above in the Research Method section) and will provide a basis of estimate that supports and blends nicely with our qualitative data, effectively revealing a result on South Korean opinion-based data. The data collected by these methods will be compared with our assumptions, research questions and analyzed against results found in similar polling data our team has collected. Current estimates find the South Korean public hold a favorable opinion [nearby 60% positive indication] of the United States. This favorability index of US presence has proven to be reasonably consistent over the last 60 years, which is highlighted as our benchmark position. We feel strongly about this number due to the amount of historical reference material, to include polling. (Kim, 2017)
 
Qualitative Findings:
 
Of more interest will be the results of our qualitative questions. Our goal and intention include the development of a highly scrutinized report, addressing expected nuanced returns that detail how South Koreans feel about the lasting US military presence in the West-Pac region. 
 
Study Limitations: 
 
Some quantitative data collection limitations we will navigate include sampling bias, measurement error, generalizability, and confounding variables. We aim to use our comprehensive library of existing data scraping tools to clean, organize and analyze all inputs, and will publish a report detailing identified limitations.
 
Qualitatively, we could be limited to a smaller than anticipated sample size due to unstable political tensions. In the wake of recent political turmoil, one of the biggest risks on our radar is the safety of participants resulting from a closure of the international border. A border closure could restrict access to certain segments of our sampling size and registered participants who may be traveling or assigned to extra military duties, caregiving, etc. This unknown development could facilitate a hindrance in the amount of diversity which has been designed into and assumed to be included in our results. As of this time, we do not see a need to postpone this study and that political tensions are serious, but not debilitating. 
 
Despite the above challenges, we feel positioned strongly to reach the people we intend to communicate with and survey, therefore hedging against researcher bias, political turmoil, or the compromising of our participant data. Due to our forward-looking stance, we have positioned multiple methods of input collection by using a series of surveyors and steering away from using the same set of surveyor/participant relationships. For example, specifically targeting researcher bias, our plan of protecting the participant from developing any lasting impression of their surveyors, aims to eradicate but at least, minimize the effects from any developing personal feelings or perspectives which could contaminate our results, damaging our credibility. 
 
One risk we do see quantifiable exposure to, is the possibility of ambiguous responses, or unclear/incoherent, uncaptured data. We will provide updates accordingly on the success or failure of the qualitative data collection process as needed - specifically whether we feel the quality of responses cannot be maintained or summarized due to age, health or other related concerns.
